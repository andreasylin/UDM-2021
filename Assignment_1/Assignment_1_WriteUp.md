**My Understanding of the 3 Maps**
These 3 maps each help display certain frequencies of complaints in various locations (classified by zip codes) around New York City. The first map
shows the areas (or zip codes) with the least amount of 311 complaints to areas with the most amount. By splitting into 5 easily distinguishable 
quantiles (with various shades of red), the map helps emphasize messier, and potentially more dangerous areas. Depending on my roles, this map provides 
me with different useful information. As a government agent, I may want to increase funding or human resources in the extremely red zones. As a tourist, 
I may want to be cautious about visiting these areas.

The second map displays more or less the same information. However, it specifies on firework related complaints specifically. Again, from the 
different shades of red, I am able to see which areas have the most illegal firework activity, as well as which areas are more “firework-free”. 
Finally, the third map shows the percentage of complaints that are firework related. In this map, I can see which areas are perhaps the most furious 
about fireworks, because evidently, there is a higher percentage of complaints that are directed towards fireworks in the red zones.

**Ideas on How to Improve Data Visualization**
Although I think the maps do help represent important information about the complaints, the display method of *Equal Counts* (quantile) inevitably has 
some flaws, as the professor mentioned during the lecture. For one, the maps do not point out outliers well, which may be more important for map readers
to know. We see this especially in the reddest margin. The range is typically quite large (1910-4560, 60.4-475, 4-50). 50% compared to 4% is a large 
difference, but we do not see this difference highlighted on our third map (it’s all just very red). This could be fixed by using the *Natural Breaks* 
method instead. Secondly, the map does not account for population per zip code, but only the number of complaints in each zip code. Two zips with 
relatively similar surface area may have vastly different population numbers. If the complaint numbers are both around the 4000s, the zip with less 
people is actually much more dangerous. We can fix the issue and display this information through a per capita approach, where we are not just using the
raw complaint numbers but dividing those with the population of each zip code, and then displaying those numbers. Finally, there is the concern for 
surface area not being accounted for (or population density, rather). The scenario would be if two zip codes had similar amounts of complaints, but vastly
different surface areas. In this case, the smaller zip code would be much more dangerous. This can be overcome by altering the data once again — divide 
the complaints by surface area to get complaints per area unit. Then, display that information.
